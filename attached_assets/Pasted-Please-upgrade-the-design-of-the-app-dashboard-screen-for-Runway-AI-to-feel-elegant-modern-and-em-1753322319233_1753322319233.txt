Please upgrade the design of the /app dashboard screen for Runway AI to feel elegant, modern, and emotionally resonant — while maintaining structure and not appearing empty.

🧁 Aesthetic Goals:
Clean, premium, pageant-inspired

Interactive and motivating

Designed for Gen Z & millennial pageant competitors

🎨 UI & Layout Instructions:
1. Header Section (Top)
Remove the magenta block and replace it with:

A soft translucent or frosted glass container (backdrop-blur) that blends into the pink background

Include:
Welcome back, okandy ✨
👑 Queen Mode: ON in soft gold or animated sparkle tag

Add a subtle animated crown or sparkle in the top-right corner

2. Hero Headline
Replace with a split-style heading for stronger hierarchy:

First line: Ready to (light, uppercase, smaller)

Second line: OWN THE RUNWAY (bold, larger, elegant serif or display font)

Third line: okandy? (italic or script style, playful)

3. Coming Up Card (Event Block)
Keep the "Photoshoot – Monday July 28" event, but enhance:

Add an icon thumbnail (e.g., 📸 or silhouette of a camera)

Button: [ Practice Now → ] styled as soft pink with glow

Animated entrance: slight fade and slide-in from right

Use soft shadows and hover glow

4. Calendar Block
Retain the calendar but upgrade style:

Add soft pink glow aura on selected date

Add mini icons for special event days (👗 for Dress Day, 🎤 for Practice, 📸 for Shoot)

Hover interaction: subtle zoom or light ring

Consider rounded container with slight padding and shadow for modern feel

5. Add New Section: Daily Practice Pick
Add a new card under the calendar:

Title: "Today’s Practice Pick"

Content: "Turn & Pose – Precision Drill (Level 2)"

Button: [ Start Practice → ]

Optional: animated shimmer bar or avatar preview

Slight vertical bounce on hover or entry animation

6. Bottom Nav Bar
Keep as-is but add:

Animated glow underline on selected tab (Home)

Confirm icons are centered and responsive

✨ Visual Treatments:
Maintain a soft blush pink gradient background

Use shadows, rounded corners, glowing accents

Apply transition-all for smooth animations (~200ms)

Use high-contrast white for card containers (bg-white/80), elevated with shadow-xl or ring-1 ring-pink-300/20

✅ Summary:
Keep structure, enhance clarity, emotion, and elegance. The result should feel aspirational, motivating, and luxurious — like entering a personal coaching lounge with a touch of magic ✨
