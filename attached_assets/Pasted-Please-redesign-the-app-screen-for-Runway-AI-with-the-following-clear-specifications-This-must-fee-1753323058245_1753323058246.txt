Please redesign the /app screen for Runway AI with the following clear specifications. This must feel premium, clean, useful, and elegant — not childish, not gamified, and not cluttered. The result should look similar in tone and cleanliness to Cal AI, with its elegant spacing, smooth interactions, and real-world utility.

🔝 1. Top Welcome Banner
Replace the magenta block with a clean, elegant top banner using either a soft blush-pink gradient or light glassmorphism (backdrop-blur, bg-white/10, etc.).

Layout:

Left side: Welcome back, okandy (use light sans-serif font) — with no emojis or childish effects.

Right side: Display a circular avatar (placeholder for now) — clean, no gradient bubble or ‘OK’ badge.

Padding should be generous but balanced.

No hover states or dropdowns needed — keep it static and elegant.

🔘 2. 7-Day Engagement Tracker
Directly under the top banner, place seven horizontally aligned small circular indicators — styled exactly like Cal AI’s micro nutrient rings:

Each circle represents one day of the week (M, T, W…).

Filled circle = user opened and interacted with the app on that day.

Unfilled = no usage.

Below each circle, place the respective day abbreviation ("M", "T", etc.) in light text.

Use a soft animation to pulse the current day’s circle on page load.

No streak counter, no score, no overdesign — just this tracker.

📅 3. Coming Up Section (Events Only)
Show a single clean card titled “Coming Up”.

Each card contains:

Icon (e.g., 📸 for photoshoot)

Title: “Photoshoot”

Date: “Monday, July 28”

DO NOT include any CTA like “Practice Now” or buttons.

The card should use a clean bg-white, rounded-xl, and shadow-md.

Font should remain consistent with overall design language.

🗓 4. Calendar Redesign
Replace the current block calendar with a compact and modern weekly calendar:

Layout:

Horizontally scrollable row of 7 pills (e.g., <Sun> <Mon> <Tue>)

Each pill contains the date number and small colored dot if there’s an event.

Selected day is highlighted with a soft pink halo (ring-2 ring-pink-400)

No grid, no bold borders — keep everything light, breathable, and modern.

If horizontal scroll implementation is not feasible, use a minimal full-month calendar:

Remove hard borders and lines

Add clean spacing between weeks

Highlight selected day with soft glow, not solid color

Add only minimal icons (📸, 🎤, 👗) where relevant

🖼 5. Photo Upload Cluster
At the bottom of the screen, directly above the navigation bar, add a cluster of user-uploaded photos:

Display these as small overlapping rounded square photo cards (about 80x80px)

Photos should have soft drop shadows and slight random rotation for personality

Show 3–5 photos in a cluster

Far-left of the cluster, place a + button to upload more photos (styled identically to the cards, but with a + icon)

No text or actions on the photos — just visual, emotional memory cues

🧼 Design Guidelines
Spacing: Use generous vertical padding between sections (~24px).

Typography: Elegant sans-serif fonts; weight contrast but no display fonts or serifs.

Colors: Stick to blush-pink, soft whites, and light gray accents.

Shadows: Use subtle depth (shadow-md or shadow-lg) on all cards — not overdone.

Animations: Minimal — only where functional (e.g., gentle pulse on current-day dot or button hover).

🚫 Do NOT Include:
Any form of “Queen Mode” or gamified language

Fake metrics like “Stage Readiness” or scores

Practice Now buttons or routine suggestions

“Today’s Pick” or AI coaching suggestions

Emoji overload or childish styling

✅ End Result Should Feel:
Sophisticated, like a daily companion app from Apple or Glossier

Emotional but real, not motivationally fake

Minimal, with room to breathe

Useful, with every element grounded in actual utility
