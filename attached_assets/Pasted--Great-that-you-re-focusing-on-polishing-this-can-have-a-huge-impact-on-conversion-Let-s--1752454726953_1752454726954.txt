or

---

## 💥 **2️⃣ Add a subtle subheading to each plan**

**Monthly:**
"Perfect for trying it out or casual training."

**Yearly:**
"Best for serious martial artists ready to commit and dominate."

---

## 🟥 **3️⃣ Visually highlight yearly plan more boldly**

* Add a **strong border glow or background gradient** (e.g., red or subtle dark neon inspired by CoachT branding).

## 💎 **7️⃣ Add icons or small visual cues**
