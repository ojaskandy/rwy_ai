## No-Code Prompt for Replit Agent: Interview Coach (Pageant Edition, Whisper-based)

**Goal:**  
Enable pageant contestants to practice and receive feedback using speech-to-text (Whisper API), with seamless UX for "Questions" and "Rounds" interview coaching.

### User Journey & UI Flow

#### 1. **Coach Tab: Entry Point**
- User clicks **“Coach”**.
- Two options appear:
  - **Questions**
  - **Rounds**

#### 2. **If User Selects “Questions”**
- Prompt: “Choose your time limit for each answer”  
  - Options: 30s, 45s, 60s, 75s, 90s.
- On selection, randomly display a question from the existing pool.
- Show a **countdown timer** matching the selected limit.
- User starts speaking; audio is streamed or recorded.

  - While user speaks, **transcribe speech using Whisper Speech-to-Text**.
    - Display live transcription in a text area for confirmation.

- On timer reaching zero (or if the user clicks “Submit”):
  - Stop recording.
  - Submit the transcript to OpenAI for **grading** as a pageant response.
    - Grading prompt should consider criteria like clarity, impact, authenticity, relevance, poise, and “wow factor” judged as a pageant would.
  - Display feedback.
    - Show options: **“Next Question”** or **“Stop”**.

#### 3. **If User Selects “Rounds”**
- Prompt: “How many questions in this round?” (user picks any value, e.g., 3–10).
- Prompt: “Choose your time limit per question” (same time options).
- On start, execute this loop:
  - For each round/question:
    - Randomly select a question from the pool.
    - Show timer, start recording/transcription.
    - Stop and log user’s response at the end of time.
    - No feedback shown after each question.
- After the last question:
  - Submit all responses to OpenAI **at once**:
    - Request **comprehensive feedback on overall interview performance**.
    - Also request **individual feedback per question**, referencing the precise answer given.

### No-Code Prompt to Replit Agent

**Prompt Start**

You are building an Interview Coach for pageant contestants.
The user enters the Coach tab and chooses between two modes:

### 1. “Questions” Mode:
- Ask the user to pick a time limit for their answer (30s, 45s, 60s, 75s, or 90s).
- Randomly choose a question from the pool and display it.
- Start a countdown timer for the chosen duration.
- While timer is running, record the user's speech and use the Whisper API (gpt-4o-transcribe or whisper-1) to transcribe their answer in real time. Show the transcription as feedback.
- When the timer ends, submit the transcribed answer to OpenAI completion API with the following grading prompt:

> “You are a top judge in elite international pageants. Grade the answer below as if it is a pageant interview question response by a contestant. Focus on content, clarity, authenticity, impact, relevance to the question, and poise. Provide feedback the way a coach would: what was strong, what could be improved, and a 1–10 score on overall impression.”
> [USER RESPONSE HERE]

- After feedback, ask if the user wants to try another question (“Next Question”) or end the session.

### 2. “Rounds” Mode:
- Ask the user how many questions they want in their round (any number, e.g., 3–10).
- Ask for a time limit for each answer (same time options).
- For each question:
  - Randomly select a question from the pool and display.
  - Start the timer.
  - Record/transcribe the user’s answer with Whisper.
  - Proceed to next question without giving feedback.
- After all questions are answered:
  - Submit all responses together to OpenAI with the following grading prompt:

> “You are judging a simulated pageant interview. Below is a series of interview questions and the contestant’s answers. Provide:
> 1. Overall feedback on their interview skills, strengths, areas for improvement, and emotional impression.
> 2. For each question, give a brief specific critique referencing what was actually said and a 1–10 score.”
> [LIST OF QUESTIONS & USER RESPONSES]

- Display both overall feedback and per-question feedback at the end.

**Additional Implementation Notes:**
- If you need live transcription, use OpenAI’s streaming transcription API endpoints and show interim results.
- Ensure time limits are enforced (recording/transcription cuts off at the set timer).
- Pick questions randomly each time (do not repeat in same round).
- All prompts, timers, and flows are managed in the UI—no code required from the user.
```

### Table: Feature-to-API Mapping

| User Action                       | Whisper/OpenAI API Usage                              |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Record/transcribe response        | Whisper Speech-to-Text (`gpt-4o-transcribe` or `whisper-1`) |
| Grading for single answer         | OpenAI Chat Completion with pageant grading prompt    |
| Grading for rounds                | OpenAI Chat Completion with multi-answer grading prompt|

**Pro Tip:**  
If you want to enrich grading with inflection/emotion/voice analytics, pipe the user’s original audio into a prosody/emotion detection module and add that as context in the grading prompt. (Optional, but gives premium feel for advanced users!)
